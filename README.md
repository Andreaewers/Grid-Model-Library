# Grid-Model-Library
Library of modified grid models for Topology and Redispatch Optimization. The purpose of the modifications is to use the grid model to optimize redispatch and grid topology to avoid overloads. 

# Contents
Provided data includes modified grid models in uct file format ([format description](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwihooTz0vOEAxUd8wIHHaM0AoIQFnoECBMQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.entsoe.eu%2Ffileadmin%2Fuser_upload%2F_library%2Fpublications%2Fce%2Fotherreports%2FUCTE-format.pdf&usg=AOvVaw0Gm2W7eOSXAeIEZ40vH2vk&opi=89978449)) as well as synthetically generated system use cases (SUC) that cause overloads in the grid in the n-1-case (if one grid element fails).
